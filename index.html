    <h1>Privacy Policy for SpyGuard</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: December 25, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application <strong>SpyGuard: App Lock &amp; Security</strong>
      ("Application") for mobile devices that was created by <strong>Jaimin Prajapati</strong>. The Application provides
      app locking, intruder detection, and general security features for your Android device.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Application is designed to prioritize user privacy. For the majority of its functions, the Application does
      <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store personal information on any external servers. All data processing
      is performed locally on your device.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Key Data Handling:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Lock Settings:</strong> Your PIN and app lock configurations are stored securely on your
          device locally.</li>
        <li><strong>Intruder Photos:</strong> Photos captured during failed unlock attempts are stored in your device's
          local memory and are not shared or uploaded anywhere.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>2. Permissions Used &amp; Why</h2>
    <p>To provide its security features, the Application requires the following permissions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Query All Packages:</strong> To allow you to select which apps you want to lock and protect.</li>
      <li><strong>Usage Statistics Access:</strong> To detect when a locked application is being launched so the lock
        screen can be displayed.</li>
      <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To take a photo of an intruder when an incorrect PIN is entered (optional feature).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Foreground Service:</strong> To ensure the security monitor stays active in the background to protect
        your apps instantly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services (Advertising)</h2>
    <p>We use third-party advertising services to support the free version of this Application. These services may
      collect certain device identifiers or location information to serve personalized ads.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> AdMob may collect data as outlined in the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>. This may include
        Advertising ID and device identifiers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and
      procedural safeguards to protect info we process and maintain locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a
      parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he
      or she should contact us.</p>
